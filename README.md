Contact Book Using C++ 

Introduction

Today, The World is Larger than Ever has more People, Our population has become larger and remembering information has become more difficult because of the large number of information that we are required to memorize, and each of us has a lot of acquaintances and friends, and since our world today has become sophisticated and uses advanced technology, so I had to program an application that allows us to save contacts. 

Project was made to Boost My Skills in Programming and it did what it was meant to do such as Boosting my skills in Object Oriented Programming in C++ in such an important Topics Like [ Classes & Objects & Constructors & Destructor & Class Members ], Besides it Made me Search for More information about other Topics You will find my Resources and How I have written my programs in the other sections. [ Now, I’m Miles away ]

Summary

The Contact Book Application is a Program Designed to help Users Keep Track of their Contacts, Store their Phone Numbers and Email Address, and Easily Access This Information When they need it.
The project is Contact Book Application that has the Ability to Add, Delete, Modify, Search and Displaying Contacts. More Info, it has the Fastest and Smoothest and Efficient Process.

Testing :

As I said before, this Project has gone throw a lot of testing in order to get to the final result, at a specific time of the project, I was doing tests every second to make sure that the program was running successfully and been throw debugging process, every class was made and done with approximately 12 tests and was optimized with more tests to get to the best solution and the most efficient, finally the project was a success based on other people’s opinion and Testing Results at a Specific Time. 


Conclusion

In conclusion, the project implementation yielded positive results in terms of My Colleagues participation and test result. While the main goal of the project is to Help Users Save their Contacts and Keep Track of them, they were also able to Save, Edit, Delete, Display Them.
The Main Purpose of the Book was a success based on other’s opinion and Test Results. 

Upgrade :

After the big amount of testing cases and my colleagues opinion about the Project, I decided to make More Features in the Program (if the Professor approved the idea) Such as: 

1.	Add Save and Open File.

2.	Make a good interface with Users.

3.	Optimize the Execution.
